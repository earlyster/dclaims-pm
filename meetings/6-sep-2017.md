- Presentation of the RWOT whitepaper submission [![alt text][issue4]](https://github.com/joaosantos15/msc-thesis/issues/4)
- Discussion on how the hypercerts' project architecture can be abstracted to a scientific contribution in order to publish a paper. Two ideas came out of this discussion:
  - Use this to combat the Fake News problem (via some sort of verifiable claims model) [![alt text][issue5]](https://github.com/joaosantos15/msc-thesis/issues/5)
  - Use this to study how blockchain should be used on the development of applications. Put everything on the blockchain vs not using blockchain at all. [![alt text][issue6]](https://github.com/joaosantos15/msc-thesis/issues/6)
- Discussion of weekly meetings for progress tracking.
