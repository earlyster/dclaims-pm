# Clickbait Buster

This demo is a proof of concept of the Clickbait Buster. It's goal is to allow users to verify news articles' titles.

## Instructions
0. Install [npm and nodejs](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
1. Clone the repo
2. Open two terminal windows (one for the server, one for the client)

#### Server
3. Go to `cd building_blocks/demos/clickbait/server`
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm app.js` . This will initiate the server, running on port 8092

#### Client
6. Go to `cd building_blocks/demos/clickbait/client/website`
7. Run `sh start.sh` . This will run a python script that starts a webserver to run the website on port 8095

#### Use it!

(I'll publish a video showing how to use it)
