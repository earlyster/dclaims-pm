# December 4 Meeting

## Attendees:
- Joao Santos
- Nuno Santos

## Agenda:
- Demo the chrome extension
- Discuss the architecture, mostly about the cost structure. [Tracked in #27](https://github.com/inesc-id/hypercerts-pm/issues/27)
    - Issuers of claims got to pay for the cost of the transaction (ethereum)
    - There should be a way to reward them (since they are making all the work and on top of that are still paying to issue their claims!)
    - A natural approach to that would be to charge the people who consume the claims
        - **Problem:** If the system is to be trustless and decentralized, anyone can access the Ethereum smart-contract and get the claims, being that Ethereum read operations are free
        - **Possible solutions:**
            - Introduce something between the consumers and Ethereum (like encrypt the data in ethereum and use our servers to decrypt the stuff) ðŸ‘Ž (kind of bad, as it would become a quasi-centralized architecture)
            - Find a way to charge for Ethereum read operations, transform a read into a write (this really does not seem possible, but it's worth thinking about it, at least) 
            - Implement a donations based mechanism, similar to Wikipedia, where we assume enough consumers will donate enough money to reimburse issuers for their costs of issuing claims (this could be done automatically with a voting mechanism, where the claims with the most upvotes would receive the most money)
            - Implement an escrow mechanism, similar to insurance, where users would bet against the truthfulness of claims and when claims were proven to be truthful (voting mechanism, [like augur.net](https://augur.net))
