## Agenda
Taking into consideration the [architecture proposal](https://github.com/inesc-id/hypercerts-pm/blob/master/hypercerts-architecture.md), established well defined goals on the implementation level. We mainly discussed the  _Clickbait Checker_ implementation.

## Outcomes
Idea for the deliverable product:
Have a mocked news website, which has news articles. The goal is to create a proof of concept (for our 'fake' website, that can then be extended to work with other news' websites).



> For the Readers

There is a notification box for every article that shows the claims made about that article's title.
> For the Verifiers

In each news article's page, there is a button to issue a Review about the news article's title. The review results on a verifiable claim being issued.

### Implementation stages
> Step 1 - website visual interface

* Build a simple website with sample news articles
* Add notifications to the news articles
* Add a form to create a review about a news article

> Step 2- Centralized back-end

* Implement create_vc() and retrieve_vc() with a regular database (or IPFS?)
    * Display the vc's on the website


> Step 3 - Decentralized & Trustless back-end

* Replace centralized/trusted systems with decentralized/trustless ones.
